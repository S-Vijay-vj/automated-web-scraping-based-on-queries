[21] A few days before its stock exchange debut, the company announced its MPDV (Multi-Purpose Delivery Vehicle) product line. The entry level van was expected to sell for $33,000 on arrival in limited quantities in 2022, ramping up to volume production in 2023. [22] In mid-January 2021, The Verge reported that in the first half of 2020 Canoo had been in talks with Apple for a potential role in its secretive Titan car project . [23] [24] In May 2022, it was reported that Canoo was struggling to find funding, the company saying that it had only enough funding to operate for one more quarter. [25] It was also revealed around the same time that Canoo was suing investor Pak Tim Li, claiming they were selling shares improperly. [26] In December 2022, the company sued several former executives of stealing Canoo's trade secrets and poaching talent for their new business, [27] [28] competing EV startup Harbinger Motors. [29] Corporate changes [ edit ] On March 11, 2021, Canoo announced the Canoo Pickup Truck , an electric pickup set to release in 2023. [30] [31] Canoo announced plans to offer both single-motor and dual-motor all-wheel drive options for their pickup truck, with the latter being capable of producing 600 hp (450 kW) and 550 foot-pounds (750 J) of torque. [30] The company said that the truck would have over 200 miles (320 km) of range and a 1,800 lb (820 kg) payload capacity. [30] After the announcement, shares of the company rose by 14%. [31] It was announced in March 2021 that Canoo had terminated its partnership with Hyundai Motor Group due to a change in corporate strategy. The company also announced that it would shift away from vehicle subscriptions to selling commercial vehicles. [32] On April 22, 2021, the company announced that co-founder and CEO Ulrich Kranz was stepping down and would be replaced by chairman Tony Aquila as CEO. [33] Also in April 2021, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation into Canoo after its merger with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV due to a string of executive departures, sudden changes to its business model, and class-action lawsuits brought by shareholders. [34] On June 17, 2021, the company announced they would build a new factory in Pryor, Oklahoma (just outside Tulsa ) to manufacture all of their future vehicles. [35] [36] The plant will be used to build ""pod-shaped vans it calls 'lifestyle vehicles' beginning in 2023."" [36] The same day, Dutch media reported that the Dutch company VDL Nedcar would start producing Canoo Minivans for the European market. [37] Later in the year, Canoo and VDL ended the manufacturing agreement. [38] On November 15, 2021, the company announced it would move its headquarters to Bentonville, Arkansas and establish a manufacturing plant there. [39] As of December 2022 [update] the company still lists Torrance, California as its headquarters. [1] [40] In January 2022, Canoo entered into a 10-year US$17.7 million lease for a building in Bentonville, Arkansas for an ""advanced industrialization facility"" to be used for low-volume manufacturing. [41] In August 2022, Canoo disclosed they had contracted with a third party for their initial vehicle production. Following receipt of orders in October 2022, Canoo announced plans for construction of a vehicle battery production facility at the MidAmerica Industrial Park (MAIP) in Pryor, Oklahoma. [42] This was in addition to its earlier announcement of plans for a vehicle production plant at MAIP capable of producing 300,000 vehicles per year. [43] In late November 2022, Canoo announced an agreement to purchase of an existing 630,000 square foot plant in Oklahoma City to start vehicle production by 2023, prior to completion of its micro megafactory in Pryor. [44] In April 2023, the company announced that battery production would proceed at Pryor to fulfill a United States Department of Defense contract; and, while vehicle manufacturing was to start in Oklahoma City before the end of 2023, long range plans still included vehicle assembly at Pryor because the OKC facility would not meet full production needs. [45] The Oklahoma City plant transaction was completed on April 7, 2023; the plant was formerly owned and operated by Terex . [46] Firm orders [ edit ] On April 13, 2022, NASA selected Canoo to supply crew transportation vehicles for its Artemis program , with a total contract value of $147,855. [47] [48] In July 2022, Walmart entered into a definitive agreement to purchase 4,500 all-electric Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles (LDV) from Canoo, with an option to buy up to 10,000 in the future. [49] Under the terms, Walmart can terminate the agreement for convenience upon 30 days notice. [50] Canoo announced two major orders in mid-October 2022. Zeeba, a relatively unknown fleet leasing operation, also based in Greater Los Angeles , ordered a combination of 5,450 LDVs and Lifestyle Vehicles (LV), with a binding commitment of 3,000 by 2024. [51] [52] [53] Some days later, Canoo announced its biggest sale to date, an order from Kingbee, a Utah-based work-ready van fleet rental company. In addition to the binding order of 9,300 LDVs, Kingbee has the option to double the order. [54] [55] Kingbee outfits its vans for fleet customers in construction trades (electrical, plumbing, energy), delivery, and mobile health. [56] In January 2024, Canoo announced the Postal Service (USPS) order for six right-hand-drive LDV vans.

This force examines the intensity of competition within the industry Canoo Inc. operates in. Understanding the competitive landscape is vital in assessing the company’s position and potential for success. Next, we will delve into the force of supplier power . Suppliers play a significant role in the operations of any company, and their level of power can impact Canoo Inc.’s business operations and bottom line. Then, we will analyze the force of buyer power . Understanding the power and influence of buyers in the market is crucial for Canoo Inc. in determining its pricing strategy and customer relationships. Following that, we will explore the force of threat of substitutes . This force evaluates the potential alternatives to Canoo Inc.’s products or services, posing a threat to its market share and profitability. Lastly, we will examine the force of threat of new entrants . This force assesses the barriers to entry for new competitors in Canoo Inc.’s industry, impacting the company’s long-term sustainability and competitive advantage. As we unravel the implications of these forces on Canoo Inc. (GOEV), it becomes clear that a comprehensive understanding of Michael Porter’s Five Forces is essential for strategic decision-making and navigating the complexities of the business environment. So, stay tuned as we embark on this insightful journey into the Five Forces that shape the competitive landscape of Canoo Inc. (GOEV). Bargaining Power of Suppliers When analyzing the competitive landscape of Canoo Inc. (GOEV), it’s important to consider the bargaining power of suppliers as one of Michael Porter’s Five Forces. This force refers to how much leverage suppliers have in setting prices and terms for the company. Supplier Concentration: The concentration of suppliers in the electric vehicle industry can greatly impact Canoo Inc.'s ability to negotiate prices and terms. If there are only a few suppliers for key components, they may have more power to dictate terms. Switching Costs: If there are high switching costs associated with changing suppliers, Canoo Inc. may have less leverage in negotiations. Suppliers can use this as leverage to maintain higher prices and less favorable terms. Impact on Quality: If the quality of a supplier's components significantly impacts the quality of Canoo Inc.'s vehicles, the supplier may have more bargaining power in setting prices and terms. Availability of Substitutes: The availability of substitutes for key components can impact the bargaining power of suppliers. If there are few alternatives, suppliers may have more power. Overall, the bargaining power of suppliers is an important factor for Canoo Inc. to consider in maintaining a competitive position in the electric vehicle market. The Bargaining Power of Customers One of the Michael Porter’s Five Forces that can significantly impact Canoo Inc. (GOEV) is the bargaining power of customers. This force refers to the ability of customers to put pressure on the company and influence pricing and quality. Brand Loyalty: Canoo Inc. needs to consider the level of brand loyalty among its customers. If customers are loyal to the Canoo brand, they may have less bargaining power as they are willing to pay premium prices for the company's products. Switching Costs: If the switching costs for customers are low, such as in the case of electric vehicles where there are many options available, the bargaining power of customers increases as they can easily move to a competitor’s product. Information Availability: With the widespread availability of information and reviews online, customers are more informed and can easily compare products and prices. This can give them more bargaining power as they have more knowledge about the market. Price Sensitivity: If customers are highly price sensitive, they can exert pressure on Canoo Inc. to lower prices, impacting the company’s profitability. Product Differentiation: The level of differentiation in Canoo's products compared to its competitors can also impact the bargaining power of customers. If Canoo offers unique features or experiences, customers may be willing to pay higher prices, reducing their bargaining power. The Competitive Rivalry: Michael Porter’s Five Forces of Canoo Inc. (GOEV) When analyzing the competitive landscape of Canoo Inc. (GOEV), it is essential to consider the competitive rivalry within the industry. Michael Porter's Five Forces framework provides a valuable tool for assessing the intensity of competition and the potential impact on a company's profitability. Rivalry Among Existing Competitors: Canoo Inc. operates in the electric vehicle market, which has seen a surge in competition in recent years. Established players such as Tesla, Ford, and General Motors, as well as new entrants like Rivian and Lucid Motors, pose a significant threat to Canoo's market share. The intense rivalry in the EV industry puts pressure on pricing, innovation, and marketing strategies. Threat of New Entrants: While the electric vehicle market presents opportunities for new entrants, the capital-intensive nature of the industry and the need for advanced technology and infrastructure act as barriers to entry. However, Canoo must remain vigilant against potential disruptive startups that could enter the market with innovative business models. Threat of Substitutes: In the context of electric vehicles, the threat of substitutes comes from alternative forms of transportation, such as traditional gasoline-powered vehicles, public transportation, and emerging technologies like autonomous vehicles. Canoo needs to differentiate its offerings and provide unique value to mitigate the impact of substitute products. Supplier Power: As a manufacturer of electric vehicles, Canoo relies on a network of suppliers for components and materials. The bargaining power of these suppliers can influence production costs and ultimately affect the company's competitiveness. Canoo must manage its relationships with suppliers effectively to ensure a stable and cost-effective supply chain. Buyer Power: The growing popularity of electric vehicles gives consumers more options and bargaining power. Canoo must focus on building brand loyalty, delivering exceptional customer experiences, and differentiating its products to retain and attract buyers in a highly competitive market. The Threat of Substitution One of the key forces in Michael Porter’s Five Forces framework is the threat of substitution. This force refers to the likelihood of customers finding alternative products or services that can fulfill the same need or desire as the company’s offerings. Competitive Pricing: Substitution becomes a significant threat when there are similar products or services available at a lower price point. In such cases, customers may choose the cheaper alternative, leading to a loss of market share for Canoo Inc. Changing Consumer Preferences: If consumer preferences shift towards alternative solutions that offer similar benefits, Canoo Inc. may face the risk of losing its customer base to these substitutes. Technological Advancements: The emergence of new technologies or innovative solutions can also pose a threat of substitution for Canoo Inc. If competitors develop more advanced or efficient products, customers may switch to these alternatives. It is important for Canoo Inc. to continuously monitor the market for potential substitutes and adapt its strategies to mitigate the threat of substitution. By staying ahead of consumer preferences and industry advancements, the company can maintain its competitive edge and minimize the risk of losing market share to substitutes. The Threat of New Entrants One of the important aspects of Michael Porter's Five Forces model is the threat of new entrants into the industry. This force assesses the likelihood of new competitors entering the market and disrupting the current competitive landscape. In the case of Canoo Inc., the threat of new entrants is a significant factor that must be considered. Capital Requirements: One barrier to entry in the electric vehicle industry is the high capital requirements. Developing and manufacturing electric vehicles requires significant investment in research and development, as well as production facilities. This high barrier to entry may deter potential new entrants. Economies of Scale: Established players like Canoo Inc. benefit from economies of scale, which make it difficult for new entrants to compete on a cost-effective basis. The ability to spread fixed costs over a large number of units gives existing companies a competitive advantage. Brand Loyalty: Canoo Inc. has been building its brand and establishing a loyal customer base, making it more challenging for new entrants to gain market share. Brand loyalty and customer switching costs can act as barriers to new competition. Regulatory Hurdles: The electric vehicle industry is subject to various regulations and standards. Navigating these regulatory hurdles can be a barrier to entry for new players, as compliance with industry-specific requirements adds complexity and cost. Technological Advancements: Canoo Inc. has invested in proprietary technology and intellectual property, creating a barrier to entry for competitors. New entrants would need to develop or acquire similar technology to effectively compete. Conclusion As we conclude our discussion on the Michael Porter’s Five Forces of Canoo Inc. (GOEV), it is evident that this framework provides a comprehensive analysis of the competitive forces at play within the electric vehicle industry. By examining the bargaining power of suppliers and buyers, the threat of new entrants, the threat of substitute products, and the intensity of competitive rivalry, companies like Canoo Inc. can gain valuable insights into their competitive position and make informed strategic decisions. Canoo Inc. faces strong bargaining power from suppliers due to the reliance on key components for their electric vehicles. The company also encounters high competitive rivalry in the industry, with established players and new entrants vying for market share. However, Canoo Inc. can capitalize on the growing demand for sustainable transportation and the increasing focus on electric vehicles, thus mitigating the threat of substitutes and attracting new customers. Additionally, the barriers to entry in the electric vehicle market serve as a deterrent for potential new competitors, providing Canoo Inc. with a degree of protection. By continuously evaluating these five forces, Canoo Inc. can adapt its strategies to navigate the dynamic landscape of the electric vehicle industry and maintain a competitive advantage. As the industry evolves, it will be crucial for Canoo Inc. to stay abreast of changing market conditions and consumer preferences in order to thrive in this highly competitive environment. Canoo Inc.

Or is there an opportunity to expand the business' product line in the future? Factors like these will boost the valuation of Canoo . If investors know Canoo will grow in the future, the company's valuation will be higher. The financial industry is built on trying to define current growth potential and future valuation accurately. All the valuation information about Canoo listed above have to be considered, but the key to understanding future value is determining which factors weigh more heavily than others. Earnings Share (0.72) Revenue Per Share 0.001 Return On Assets (0.37) Return On Equity (1.80) The market value of Canoo Inc is measured differently than its book value, which is the value of Canoo that is recorded on the company's balance sheet. Investors also form their own opinion of Canoo's value that differs from its market value or its book value, called intrinsic value, which is Canoo's true underlying value. Investors use various methods to calculate intrinsic value and buy a stock when its market value falls below its intrinsic value. Because Canoo's market value can be influenced by many factors that don't directly affect Canoo's underlying business (such as a pandemic or basic market pessimism), market value can vary widely from intrinsic value. Altman Z Score Details Piotroski F Score Details Beneish M Score Details Financial Analysis Details Buy or Sell Advice Details Earnings Projections Details Please note, there is a significant difference between Canoo's value and its price as these two are different measures arrived at by different means. Investors typically determine if Canoo is a good investment by looking at such factors as earnings, sales, fundamental and technical indicators, competition as well as analyst projections. However, Canoo's price is the amount at which it trades on the open market and represents the number that a seller and buyer find agreeable to each party. Updating Transaction...

Below is a sample report to help you understand the structure of the report you are buying Click here to download sample See what our customers are saying GlobalData provides a great range of information and reports on various sectors that is highly relevant, timely, easy to access and utilise. The reports and data dashboards help engagement with clients; they provide valuable industry and market insights that can enrich client conversations and can help in the shaping of value propositions. Moreover, using GlobalData products has helped increase my knowledge of the finance sector, the players within it, and the general threats and opportunities. I find the consumer surveys that are carried out to be extremely beneficial and not something I have seen anywhere else. They provided an insightful view of why and which consumers take (or don’t) particular financial products. This can help shape conversations with clients to ensure they make the right strategic decisions for their business. One of the challenges I have found is that data in the payments space is often piecemeal. With GD all of the data I need is in one place, but it also comes with additional market reports that provide useful extra context and information. Having the ability to set-up alerts on relevant movements in the industry, be it competitors or customers, and have them emailed directly to me, ensures I get early sight of industry activity and don’t have to search for news. Senior Account Manager, TSYS “The GlobalData platform is our go-to tool for intelligence services. GlobalData provides an easy way to access comprehensive intelligence data around multiple sectors, which essentially makes it a one-for-all intelligence platform, for tendering and approaching customers. GlobalData is very customer orientated, with a high degree of personalised services, which benefits everyday use. The highly detailed project intelligence and forecast reports can be utilised across multiple departments and workflow scopes, from operational to strategic level, and often support strategic decisions. GlobalData Analytics and visualisation solutions has contributed positively when preparing management presentations and strategic papers.” Business Intelligence & Marketing Manager, SAL Heavy Lift “COVID-19 has caused significant interference to our business and the COVID-19 intelligence from GlobalData has helped us reach better decisions around strategy. These two highlights have helped enormously to understand the projections into the future concerning our business units, we also utilise the project database to source new projects for Liebherr-Werk to use as an additional source to pitch for new business.” Market Analyst & Management, Liebherr-Werk Your daily news has saved me a lot of time and keeps me up-to-date with what is happening in the market, I like that you almost always have a link to the source origin. We also use your market data in our Strategic Business Process to support our business decisions. By having everything in one place on the Intelligence Center it has saved me a lot of time versus looking on different sources, the alert function also helps with this. Head of Key Accounts, Saab AB Having used several other market research companies, I find that GlobalData manages to provide that ‘difficult-to-get’ market data that others can’t, as well as very diverse and complete consumer surveys. Marketing Intelligence Manager, Portugal Foods Our experience with GlobalData has been very good, from the platform itself to the people. I find that the analysts and the account team have a high level of customer focus and responsiveness and therefore I can always rely on. The platform is more holistic than other providers. It is convenient and almost like a one stop shop. The pricing suite is highly competitive and value for our organisation. I like reports that inform new segments such as the analysis on generation Z, millennials, the impact of COVID 19 to our banking customers and their new channel habits. Secondly the specialist insight on affluent sector significantly increases our understanding about this group of customers. The combination of those give us depth and breadth of the evolving market. I’m in the business of answering and helping people make decisions so with the intelligence center I can do that, effectively and efficiently. I can share quickly key insights that answer and satisfy our country stakeholders by giving them many quality studies and primary research about competitive landscape beyond the outlook of our bank. It helps me be seen as an advisory partner and that makes a big difference. A big benefit of our subscription is that no one holds the whole data and because it allows so many people, so many different parts of our organisation have access, it enables all teams to have the same level of knowledge and decision support. Head of Customer Insight and Research, Standard Chartered “I know that I can always rely on Globaldata’s work when I’m searching for the right consumer and market insights. I use Globaldata insights to understand the changing market & consumer landscape and help create better taste & wellbeing solutions for our customers in food, beverage and healthcare industries. Globaldata has the right data and the reports are of very high quality compared to your competitors. Globaldata not only has overall market sizes & consumer insights on food & beverages but also provides insights at the ingredient & flavour level. That is key for B2B companies like Givaudan. This way we understand our customers’ business and also gain insight to our unique industry” Head of Consumer Sensory Insights, Givaudan GlobalData provides a great range of information and reports on various sectors that is highly relevant, timely, easy to access and utilise.

Today, consumers are more informed, connected, and empowered. They have access to vast information, opinions, and options, shaping their decision-making process. Factors such as increased connectivity, globalization, and e-commerce have contributed to this evolution. Essential Marketing Trends: To effectively reach and engage with today's consumers, businesses must align their marketing strategies with the evolving trends.

Market Trends Definition Market trends refer to the general direction in which the market for a particular product or service is moving over a specified period. These trends are derived based on various factors which can include consumer behavior, purchasing decisions, technology advancements, and macroeconomic indicators, among others. Market trends can either be positive or negative, depending on their impact on the market in question. They are important as they provide insights into the direction in which a particular market is going and help businesses to make informed decisions on investments and business strategies. Market trends can also enable businesses to identify new opportunities for growth and expansion in previously untapped markets. Types of Market Trends Market trends refer to the overall direction or movement of a particular market or an industry. Understanding the different types of market trends is of utmost importance for businesses as it enables them to make more informed decisions regarding their products, services, and marketing strategies.

Factors Affecting Market Trends Market trends are a reflection of the changing needs of consumers and businesses in an industry. These trends are influenced by several factors that include changes in technology, consumer preferences, economic conditions, and government policies. Technological advancements continue to drive the growth of many industries, and companies that invest in research and development are likely to be at the forefront of the latest trends. Consumer preferences are also a significant factor in shaping market trends, as companies strive to meet the changing needs and preferences of their customers. The current economic climate is also a crucial factor that affects market trends, as businesses adjust their operations to cope with conditions such as recessions or inflation. Changes in government policies, such as tax laws or trade agreements, can also significantly impact market trends. Successful companies are those that are agile enough to respond to changes in these factors and are willing to make necessary adjustments to maintain their competitive edge. Examples of Market Trends Examples of market trends can be observed in various industries, each reflecting the ever-changing consumer preferences and market demand. One such trend that has been on the rise is sustainability, with companies moving towards more eco-friendly and socially responsible practices. The fashion industry, for example, has seen a shift towards sustainable and ethical fashion, with increased attention being paid to supply chain transparency, fair labor practices, and the use of sustainable materials. Similarly, the food industry has witnessed a surge in demand for organic, non-GMO, and locally-sourced foods, as consumers become more conscious of their health and the environment. Another major trend is the continued growth of e-commerce, with online shopping becoming increasingly popular across industries. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this trend, with many consumers forced to shop online due to lockdowns and social distancing measures. The rise of technology is also a driving force behind market trends, with artificial intelligence and automation revolutionizing various industries from healthcare to finance. For instance, the healthcare industry has seen the implementation of telemedicine, which allows medical professionals to consult with patients remotely, while the finance industry has benefited greatly from the use of blockchain technology. These examples of market trends highlight how businesses must continually adapt to meet the changing needs and preferences of their target audience and remain competitive in the market.” Market Research vs Market Trends Differences Market research and market trends are two important concepts that businesses use to gain insight into their target markets. While they may seem similar, there are distinct differences between the two that are crucial for businesses to understand. Market research is the process of gathering information about a specific market by using a variety of techniques, such as surveys, focus groups, and interviews. It is used to gather specific information about market size, customer attitudes and behaviors, and competition. Market trends, on the other hand, focus on identifying patterns and changes in the market over time. This includes things like changes in consumer behavior, technological advancements, and shifts in popular culture. The differences between market research and market trends can be summed up as follows: market research is primarily concerned with gathering data, while market trends are focused on identifying patterns and changes over time. Market research tends to be more quantitative, while market trends tend to be more qualitative. Market research is typically used to inform decisions about products, pricing, and marketing strategies, while market trends are used to identify opportunities and potential threats in the market. The importance of both market research and market trends cannot be overstated for businesses. By understanding the differences between the two, businesses can develop a more comprehensive understanding of their target markets, which can lead to more effective decision-making. Market research provides businesses with valuable data about their customers and competitors, which is essential to developing successful marketing strategies. Market trends, on the other hand, can help businesses identify emerging opportunities and potential risks, which can be used to adjust marketing strategies and stay ahead of the competition. In conclusion, the differences between market research and market trends are important for businesses to understand. By utilizing both concepts, businesses can gain a deeper understanding of their target markets and make more informed decisions. Whether it’s gathering data on customer attitudes or identifying shifts in consumer behavior, market research and market trends are essential tools for any business looking to succeed in today’s competitive market. Importance of Both Market research and market trends are two distinct and essential components that businesses must consider to make informed decisions. While market research provides insights into consumer behavior, preferences, and market-specific data, market trends track changing market dynamics over time. Businesses that ignore these two factors are at considerable risk of making costly mistakes that may negatively impact their profitability, ROI, and growth prospects. Market research helps businesses to better understand their customers, competitors, and market trends. By conducting thorough research, businesses can determine the size of their target market, identify the needs and preferences of their customers, and optimize their product and service offerings for maximum profitability. Additionally, it can help businesses determine pricing strategies, distribution channels, and marketing campaigns that cater to their target audience. Through market research, businesses can also identify gaps in the market and capitalize on new opportunities. Market trends, on the other hand, help businesses identify prevailing patterns and shifts in consumer behavior, market dynamics and demand for specific products. By analyzing market trends, businesses can identify emerging opportunities to introduce new products, modify existing offerings, and adapt to changing market dynamics. Tracking market trends also enables businesses to better understand their competitors’ strategies and competitive positioning and identify any gaps or weaknesses in their own business strategy. While market research and market trends are different, there is considerable overlap between the two. Both are essential components that businesses must consider to make informed decisions. By combining the insights from both market research and market trends, businesses can gain a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of their target markets and make informed decisions based on that understanding. Moreover, market research and market trends help businesses spot opportunities before their competitors do, enabling them to stay ahead of the curve and sustain long-term growth and business success. Benefits of Market Research and Market Trends Business Growth Understanding the market trends and conducting market research is essential to drive business growth. Businesses can utilize market research to determine customer preferences and tailor their products and services accordingly. Market trends provide insights into emerging technologies, consumer behavior, and pricing strategies. By analyzing these trends, businesses can keep abreast of market demands and continuously innovate their products and services. Market research helps businesses understand their current market position and identify areas for improvement. By understanding customers’ needs and preferences, businesses can create more effective marketing campaigns, enhancing customer engagement and retaining more customers. By conducting research into their competitors, businesses can determine their strengths and weaknesses and use this information to gain competitive advantage. Additionally, market research can help businesses identify new market opportunities, diversify their product portfolio and enter new markets. By utilizing market trends and conducting market research, businesses can mitigate the risks associated with introducing new products, services, or entering new markets. Businesses can use market research to identify potential threats and opportunities while staying competitive within the industry. Thus, businesses must stay up to date with the latest market trends and conduct market research continually to achieve business growth and success. Competitive Advantage Understanding market research and market trends is critical for businesses to gain a competitive advantage. With the help of market research, businesses can gain insights into their target customers’ needs, behaviors, and preferences. This understanding can help businesses develop products or offer services that align with customer demands and provide a unique selling proposition. By staying up-to-date with market trends, businesses can also identify emerging markets or changes in consumer preferences, which can be used proactively to generate a competitive advantage. One example of how market research can help gain a competitive advantage is by analyzing consumer feedback. By collecting and analyzing feedback, businesses can identify areas of strength and weakness in their products or services, which can be used to improve aspects of the service or product that are falling short. This process of continuous improvement and adaptation to customer needs is essential for businesses in today’s rapidly changing marketplace. Market trends can also be used to identify opportunities and gaps in the market. For example, a business can observe an increase in demand for plant-based foods and develop new products that cater to this segment of customers. By proactively responding to market trends, businesses can stay ahead of their competitors and create a unique selling proposition that gives them a competitive edge in the market. Furthermore, analyzing market trends can help businesses gain insights into evolving customer needs and expectations. For instance, with the rise of e-commerce and online shopping, businesses need to adopt a digital-first strategy to meet the demands of customers who prefer to shop online. By adapting to changing market trends, businesses can remain relevant and continue to grow in the digital age. In conclusion, market research and market trends analysis can provide businesses with a competitive advantage by helping them understand customer needs, identifying opportunities, and adapting to changes in the market. Businesses that leverage market research to inform their decisions are more likely to succeed in the long run, as they can make more informed decisions about product development and investments, ultimately leading to sustained growth and profitability. Risk Mitigation When conducting market research and analyzing market trends, businesses can gain valuable insights that can help mitigate risks. By gathering data on customer behavior, preferences, and industry trends, businesses can make informed decisions and minimize the potential for negative outcomes. One way to mitigate risks is to identify potential areas of vulnerability in the market. By analyzing trends and conducting market research, businesses can identify potential threats such as changes in consumer behavior, shifts in industry trends, or emerging competitors. Armed with this information, businesses can develop strategies to adapt to changes and stay ahead of the competition. In addition to identifying potential risks, market research can also help businesses assess the potential impact of those risks. By analyzing market trends and customer behavior, businesses can develop scenarios that anticipate how changes in the market may impact their operations and profitability. This can help businesses ensure they have contingency plans in place to deal with unexpected events. Another way market research can help businesses mitigate risks is by enabling them to make data-driven decisions. Instead of relying on guesswork or intuition, businesses can gather data on customer needs, preferences, and behaviors to inform their decisions. This can help minimize the potential for errors and mistakes. Ultimately, market research and analysis of market trends can help businesses mitigate risks by providing valuable insights that inform decision-making. By understanding the market and their customers, businesses can make informed decisions that anticipate changes in the environment and help them stay ahead of the competition. In conclusion, conducting market research and analyzing market trends can help businesses mitigate risks by providing valuable insights for informed decision-making. Through identifying potential areas of vulnerability, assessing the impact of risks, and making data-driven decisions, businesses can minimize negative outcomes and stay ahead of the competition. Challenges of Market Research and Market Trends Data Collection One of the critical components of market research is data collection. The process of data collection involves gathering and recording information that is relevant to the research question. However, collecting accurate and relevant data poses several challenges that make the process complex and time-consuming. One of the key obstacles is the availability of accurate data sources. Researching the market and obtaining up-to-date information can be difficult, especially if the market is constantly changing. Another challenge is the issue of the representativeness of the sample. The sample selected must be representative of the population to ensure that the results are generalizable and reliable. Therefore, it is crucial to have robust and valid sampling techniques to create a representative sample. Additionally, collecting data through surveys and questionnaires can be challenging due to low response rates. A low response rate may jeopardize the validity of the data, as it may introduce bias into the results. Another challenge related to data collection is the issue of researcher bias. Researchers may have preconceived ideas or opinions that influence the data collection process and skew the results. Therefore, it is critical to mitigate researcher bias in the data collection process through training and awareness. Lastly, the data collected must be accurate, complete, and consistent. Inaccurate or incomplete data can lead to erroneous conclusions and affect the reliability of the findings. Therefore, it is crucial to have rigorous quality control mechanisms in place to ensure that the data collected is valid, reliable, and accurate. In conclusion, data collection is a critical component of market research that is fundamental to the success of any project. The challenges related to collecting accurate and relevant data are numerous and require rigorous attention to detail. Overcoming these challenges is vital to ensure that the data collected is valid, reliable, and accurate, allowing for accurate and informed decision-making. Data Analysis The process of analyzing and interpreting data collected during market research is fundamental to obtaining insights into market trends and consumer behavior. During data analysis, researchers are faced with various challenges that can affect the accuracy and relevance of their findings. One such challenge is the need to ensure that the data analyzed represents the target population accurately. This is particularly critical when dealing with large datasets that require careful sampling to ensure that the data used is representative of the population under study. Additionally, researchers must ensure that the analyzed data aligns with the research objectives set in the initial stages of the research. Failure to do so may lead to misinterpretation of data and affect the outcomes of the research. Another challenge related to data analysis is ensuring data quality. Data quality issues can arise from factors such as data collection methods, storage, and processing. Incorrectly recorded or misinterpreted data can lead to incorrect conclusions and affect the overall credibility of the research findings. To mitigate such challenges, researchers must ensure that the data collection and analysis processes are well-designed, monitored, and performed by qualified personnel. The process of data analysis is also time-consuming and requires specialized skills. Apart from the time required to clean, organize, and format data, researchers must also use appropriate statistical tools and techniques to interpret the data accurately. This can be challenging, especially when dealing with complex datasets or inadequate skills in data analysis. To address this challenge, researchers can consider outsourcing data analysis processes to specialized service providers or invest time in acquiring the necessary skills. In conclusion, data analysis forms a crucial part of the market research process. If not done properly, it can affect the accuracy and relevance of the research findings. Researchers must overcome challenges related to data quality, ensuring that the analyzed data represents the target population, and use appropriate analytical tools and techniques. By addressing these challenges, researchers can obtain actionable insights into market trends and consumer behavior, thus providing the information necessary to drive business success. Cost One of the most significant challenges related to conducting market research and analyzing market trends is the cost involved. Researching and analyzing market trends require comprehensive data collection, analysis, and accurate interpretation of information that can be expensive. Companies must make significant investments to gather, collect, and analyze market data. The cost of market research and analyzing trends varies depending on the methods used, sample size, data sources used, expertise required, and the technologies applied. The cost of hiring research professionals and purchasing or accessing research tools and data sources is also considerable. Despite the cost, market research and trend analysis are essential for businesses to gain insights into their target customers’ needs, preferences, buying behaviors, and competitors’ activities. Market research helps businesses to develop strategies and make informed decisions that can contribute to their growth and profitability. However, businesses must be aware that there are costs involved and that market research and trend analysis should be part of their budget planning. There are ways that businesses can manage the cost of market research and trend analysis. For instance, they can use cost-effective data collection methods, such as online surveys, social media monitoring, and web analytics. They can also use free or low-cost tools to manage and analyze data, such as Excel, Google Analytics, and online dashboard tools. Businesses may also consider outsourcing their market research activities to specialized companies that offer cost-effective services. Outsourcing can help businesses save money and time, as market research companies can leverage their expertise and resources to conduct research and provide insights faster and more efficiently. In summary, while the cost of conducting market research and analyzing market trends can be considerable, businesses should recognize the importance of these activities and invest accordingly in their budget planning. By managing costs, thinking creatively, and outsourcing where possible, companies can ensure that they can gain valuable insights into their target markets to aid in decision-making and strategic planning. Conclusion Summary Market research and market trends play an essential role for businesses in determining their viability, profitability, and long-term sustainability. Through analyzing market trends, businesses can gain insight into the needs and preferences of their customers and tailor their marketing strategies accordingly. Furthermore, market research provides businesses with a comprehensive understanding of their competitors, identifying opportunities for growth, and determining potential risks. The ability to stay ahead of the curve is crucial in today’s rapidly changing business environment, and market research is one of the most valuable tools for achieving this. Properly conducted market research can also provide businesses with accurate forecasts of emerging trends, enabling them to capitalize on emerging opportunities before their competitors. For businesses that are serious about achieving success in today’s market, investing in market research is not just an option, it is a necessity. In the future, market research and market trends will continue to play a pivotal role in shaping the direction of businesses. Technological advancements will enable businesses to analyze vast amounts of data, providing them with valuable insights and opportunities to gain a competitive edge. Machine learning and predictive modeling will allow businesses to forecast emerging trends and develop comprehensive strategies to stay ahead of the competition. Furthermore, as consumer behavior continues to evolve and respond to societal, cultural, and economic shifts, market research will become even more critical in enabling businesses to adapt to these changes and meet the evolving needs of their customers. In conclusion, the importance of market research and market trends for businesses cannot be overstated, and as the business environment continues to evolve, so too will the role of market research in shaping the success of businesses. Future Outlook The future of market research and market trends is constantly evolving, driven by emerging technologies and changing consumer needs. One of the biggest trends that we can expect to see in the coming years is a continued shift towards digital data collection and analysis. With the rise of social media and mobile devices, businesses are now able to gather large amounts of data on consumer behavior in real-time, providing them with valuable insights into how their target audience thinks and acts. Another key trend that we can expect to see is an increased focus on personalized marketing. As consumers become more empowered and demanding, businesses will need to find new and innovative ways to engage with them on an individual level. This will require a deeper understanding of their needs and preferences, as well as greater investment in cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. At the same time, we can also expect to see a greater emphasis on sustainability and ethical business practices in the years ahead. As consumers become more conscious of their impact on the environment, they are increasingly seeking out products and services that align with their values. This presents both a challenge and an opportunity for businesses, who will need to find ways to reduce their environmental footprint and promote social responsibility in order to stay competitive in the marketplace. Finally, we can expect to see an ongoing shift towards global markets, driven by the rise of emerging economies and the increasing interconnectedness of the world.

"Identify key trends in the market, including changes in consumer behavior, technological advancements, and shifts in the competitive landscape",https://www.thekeenfolks.com/blog-article/the-impact-of-technology-on-consumer-behaviour,"The Impact of Technology on Consumer Behaviour Home Work Services About Us Insights Community AI Trends '27 Contact Us The Impact of Technology on Consumer Behaviour By Alexa September 18, 2023 7 min reading By Alexa 7 min reading Digital Marketing The influence of technology on consumer behavior: Impossible to ignore 1. Consumers Are More Connected 2. Consumers Use Multiple Devices 3. Customers Have Higher Expectations Share: Fb Tw In September 18, 2023 The influence of technology on consumer behavior: Impossible to ignore ‍ New technology has empowered consumers. They have unlimited access to information and demand products and services when they want. Social media has given consumers a bigger voice and new channels to communicate with brands and share their opinions with peers. As the speed of technology and trends in consumer behavior accelerate, companies have to evolve quickly. The brands that deliver on consumer demands will thrive, and those that are slow to react will not survive. The 3 effects of technology on today's consumer: ‍ 1. Consumers Are More Connected ‍ Consumers are more connected to business than ever before. Using smartphones, they can research products, ask sales questions, and purchase products no matter where they are and what they are doing. For example, the time spent commuting to work on a train or bus has been massively changed because of technology and connected devices. According to a study by the Centre for Economics and Business Research, UK consumers spend over £22.8 billion per year online shopping while using public transport. When it comes to social media, consumers use these channels to interact with brands and submit customer service queries. But also as a resource to help them make purchasing decisions. According to GlobalWebIndex, 54% of social media users have used social media to research products. With consumers becoming hyper-connected, there is an increasing number of opportunities to engage new and existing customers. However, companies need to understand how they can cut through the noise and meet consumer demand. ‍ What Do Businesses Need to Do? ‍ To take advantage of this change in consumer behaviour, it's vital that the brand has a strong social media and digital presence. That starts with a dynamic digital ecosystem . Companies need to integrate all marketing channels to deliver a cohesive customer experience irrespective of the channel used to reach your business. There are more opportunities to engage consumers and improve sales revenue, but only if your business is equipped with the right tools and data infrastructure to capitalize. Companies need a deep understanding of their customers and their shopping behaviour to deliver seamless experiences consumers demand. That's only possible when customer data is effectively utilized. The success of an omnichannel marketing strategy depends entirely on the end-user experience - the customer. As consumers switch between channels, devices, e-commerce, and brick-and-mortar stores, the transition should be seamless. For example, a shopper might discover a product on Facebook and ask a sales question on the platform. After receiving an answer, the shopper visits the company website to complete the purchase but elects to pick up the product in-store. The transition between digital channels and e-commerce to brick-and-mortar should be smooth. All of the touchpoints in the journey contribute to a strong customer experience and a successful omnichannel marketing strategy. ‍ 2. Consumers Use Multiple Devices ‍ In 2019, mobile accounted for 50.44% of total global internet traffic and 77% of total digital minutes in the US. Along with increased household penetration of tablets and wearables, consumers use a wide variety of devices to access the internet and purchase products. Consumers don't use a single device throughout the buyer's journey. According to a Google report, 90% of consumers use more than one device to accomplish a single task online. A shopper looking to purchase a product might start the journey after seeing an advertisement on television and research products using their smartphone. After evaluating different products, they might use their laptop to check pricing and complete the purchase. Companies need to be there with the right messaging at the right time, whichever device their customer uses to reach out. Determining how to reach every audience segment and how digital touchpoints interconnect is the challenge that needs to be overcome. ‍ What Do Businesses Need to Do? ‍ Companies need to build an omnichannel marketing strategy to be flexible to the influence of technology on consumer behaviour . An omnichannel strategy enables the brand to create personalized, contextually relevant experiences that engage consumers in the right place, at the right time, and with the right message as they move between devices. Remarketing strategies play a crucial role in a successful omnichannel strategy. Cart and browser abandonment emails and push notifications to allow for re-engagement tactics once a shopper has left your website and switched to another device at a later time. Omnichannel means not only the integration of digital channels but also the in-store experience provided to customers. Location-based messaging can be a powerful tool for creating personalized customer experiences in-store. This approach offers a number of benefits for the business. According to a study by Monetate, shoppers that are tracked across multiple devices outperform those that aren't across several KPIs, including: 30% increase in product views 49% increase in purchases $15 increase in average order value A key advantage of an omnichannel strategy is the access to relevant customer data to inform personalization tactics and deliver the experiences that consumer demand. Customers tracked across multiple devices produce 6x more data than those that are not. ‍ 3. Customers Have Higher Expectations ‍ Consumers' expectations are at an all-time high as a result of the influence of technology . With digital pioneers continually raising the bar, your customers compare the experience of buying from you to your competitors and the experience they receive from Amazon, Netflix, etc. Consumers expect more responsive, relevant, and targeted communication, products, and services from the companies they buy from. Companies used to have set business hours, and consumers would have to wait before contacting a customer service representative or purchasing a product. Consumers now expect tailored experiences on demand. If a consumer is forced to wait for a response from customer service or to buy a product, they will find a competitor that offers a better experience. The bar for satisfactory customer experience is higher, with consumers expecting more and more from companies. Consumers are aware of their power and will use it when they don't receive a positive experience when dealing with a company. According to a study by American Express, over 50% of Americans have scrapped a planned purchase because of a bad customer experience, and 74% of people have switched brands because the purchasing process was too difficult. For businesses that fail to acknowledge and meet consumer demands, smaller market share and irrelevance will result. ‍ What Do Businesses Need to Do? ‍ While the influence of technology on consumer behavior is the cause of higher expectations, it also offers companies solutions to meet those expectations. Marketing automation software and AI-powered chatbots enable brands to better communicate with their customers. Chatbots are becoming increasingly integrated into the everyday lives of consumers. According to Mobile Marketer, 40% of millennials interact with chatbots daily. AI-powered chatbots enable companies to be there with relevant messaging and information whenever the consumer chooses to reach out. This has a significant impact on customer service, and the experience brands can offer to their customers. Consumers are also increasingly more willing to purchase directly through chatbots. According to HubSpot's research, 47% of consumers are open to making a purchase from a chatbot. Chatbots also provide detailed records of conversations with customers. This provides a new stream of data that can be analyzed to reveal insights on consumer pain points and ways to improve products and services. As more and more companies utilize AI to empower their customer communications and marketing, consumer expectations will increase even further. Companies need to prepare and equip their departments with the tools they need to provide a consistently high-quality experience that exceeds their customers' expectations. ‍ ‍ Conclusion Technology is continually evolving and will always impact consumer behavior. The speed of that change is getting faster and faster. With IoT and 5G still emerging, companies need to prepare by identifying trends now and capitalizing before it is too late. The influence of technology is a powerful catalyst for change. If companies don't move with technology, they will be left behind and see their market share fall.

"Identify key trends in the market, including changes in consumer behavior, technological advancements, and shifts in the competitive landscape",https://www.market-xcel.com/blogs/navigating-the-shifting-tides-consumer-behaviour-trends,"Navigating the Shifting Tides: Consumer Behaviour Trends Navigating the Shifting Tides: Consumer Behaviour Trends Oct 3, 2023 Consumer behaviour has undergone a tsunami of changes in the past 2 years, moving in paradoxical directions. Consequently, the consumer products, hospitality, and retail sectors have experienced significant disruptions. A key takeaway from this period is that companies must find innovative ways to engage consumers in a fiercely competitive landscape where physical and digital experiences are converging. Leading consumer-centric businesses now prioritize listening to consumers due to the rapidly evolving and sometimes contradictory nature of consumer sentiment and behaviour. Today’s consumers are both cost-conscious and willing to indulge, gravitating towards both established giants and emerging niche brands. Staying attuned to these shifts is challenging yet crucial for companies but swift decision-making to meet consumer expectations in this diverse landscape is paramount. Technological advancements empower consumer-oriented companies spanning diverse sectors to harness consumer data, facilitating personalized experiences. Salesforce research reveals that 66% of consumers expect companies to understand their unique needs, with 52% anticipating personalized offers. This underscores the need to move beyond one-size-fits-all approaches and utilize data and behavioural science to discern what consumers want and when they want it. Trading down and indulging selectively In today’s dynamic consumer landscape, a unique trend has emerged – consumers are trading down while splurging selectively. While trading down involves making cost-conscious choices in everyday purchases, consumers seek value without compromising quality, favouring store brands and generic options over premium labels. At the same time, they’re embracing selective splurges, allocating their budget to experiences and products that align with their passions and values. Globally, 2/3rds are trading down by opting for cheaper or private-label items. While in Europe, 84% equate branded and private-label quality, in China, consumers are increasingly price-conscious, actively pursuing discounts. McKinsey’s report reveals a paradox in U.S. consumer behavior amidst rising inflation. Despite inflation worries and job insecurity, shoppers are selectively splurging and trading down with pre-pandemic spending patterns varying in their resurgence. Meanwhile, 44% of global consumers (60% among Gen Z and millennials) intend to indulge, especially in experiential or instantly gratifying purchases like dining or travel. Regional differences link this intent to economic optimism, with 77% of Indians planning to splurge compared to just 26% of Japanese consumers. People are redefining luxury, valuing experiences over possessions and opting for eco-friendly, ethical brands. This balanced approach allows consumers to maintain a sense of indulgence while adhering to responsible consumption. Consequently, companies need a nuanced understanding of these trends and consumer segments, as splurging in one area may lead to value-seeking in another. Embracing brands and channels that enable shopping anywhere, anytime Consumer spending habits have shifted significantly towards online and discount channels, signalling a crucial change in shopping preferences. The rise of omnichannel retail has transformed consumer shopping platforms, with the e-commerce market poised to reach $7.4 trillion by 2025, driven by the focus on omnichannel experiences. Gone are the days when shopping was confined to physical stores or a single online channel. More than 60% of US and Asian consumers plan to continue using channels they tried during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as grocery delivery and social commerce. In the current purchase journey, 75% consumers desire seamless omnichannel experiences. However, only a quarter are satisfied with the current offerings from retailers. This omnichannel shift gives consumers greater flexibility, convenience, and choice, allowing them to research products online, test them in-store, and make purchases through their preferred channel. Retailers, in turn, benefit from this transformation by gaining deeper insights into customer behaviour and preferences, facilitating personalized marketing and improved customer retention. This mutually beneficial relationship fosters stronger brand loyalty and fuels growth in the ever-evolving retail landscape. As the retail landscape continues to evolve, embracing omnichannel strategies is no longer an option but a necessity for brands to thrive in this dynamic marketplace. Mere online and physical store presence falls short if consumer interactions lack seamlessness. For example, shoppers now expect in-store staff to access their online purchase history for tailored recommendations and to earn loyalty points when ordering food online. Meeting these demands is essential in catering to today’s digitally savvy consumers who seek connected, personalized experiences. Hyper-personalisation In a digital era where it appears that nearly everyone is embracing personalization, the paramount standard is now set by hyper-personalized, varied customer experiences. Hyper-personalization in consumer behaviour is a cutting-edge approach that leverages advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence to deliver tailor-made experiences. Afterall, the more you understand your users, the better you’ll serve your users. Unlike traditional personalization, hyper-personalization goes beyond basic demographics to understand individual preferences, behaviours, and context. It crafts unique customer journeys, curating content, products, and services in real-time. Behavioural data enables real-time delivery of tailored promotions and messaging, enhancing the brand experience and deepening consumer understanding. Moreover, this data serves a dual benefit by informing content strategy and expanding social influence for the brand. This phenomenon is reshaping industries by enhancing customer engagement and satisfaction. By analysing vast data sets, companies can predict consumer needs and desires, allowing for highly targeted marketing campaigns, product recommendations, content creation, customer experience and others. For instance, Amazon analyses customer browsing and purchase history to provide personalized product recommendations and, Netflix utilizes hyper-personalization to recommend movies and TV shows based on a user’s viewing history. Their recommendation algorithm analyses not only what you’ve watched but also your viewing patterns and preferences. However, hyper-personalization also raises concerns about privacy and data security. And therefore, striking the right balance between providing customized experiences and respecting personal boundaries is crucial. As consumer expectations evolve, hyper-personalization is becoming the new norm. It’s a paradigm shift that’s here to stay, offering exciting opportunities and challenges for brands and consumers alike. Balancing the comfort of the familiar with the thrill of brand exploration Consumers today are navigating a fascinating duality: finding comfort in familiarity while also open to trying different brands for the same/different type of product. On one hand, they seek the reliability and nostalgia associated with trusted brands, providing a sense of security in uncertain times. On the other hand, they’re increasingly open to experimenting with new products and services, driven by curiosity and the desire for novelty. This evolving consumer behavior presents a unique challenge for brands, and they must strike a delicate balance between maintaining brand loyalty by delivering consistent experiences and enticing adventurous consumers with fresh offerings. Adapting to this paradox is key to thriving in today’s dynamic marketplace. Historically, established brands have held sway in the consumer market during periods of instability. In the US market, large brands experienced a 50% growth peak amid the pandemic. But consumers are also trying new brands: one in three consumers did so in the past 6 months. Gen Zs and millennials are especially susceptible to brand switching, as they are 5 times more likely than older generations to believe that newer brands are better or more innovative than established brands. Today’s consumers purchase a range of products to meet specific needs, diverging from the past when one product sufficed. For instance, households no longer rely on just one milk type; they may consume cow’s milk, high-protein milk, and plant-based alternatives like oat or coconut milk. Similarly, consumers exhibit brand fluidity across items like smartphones, clothing, or coffee, forsaking strict brand allegiance. Various factors drive this behaviour, including price sensitivity, evolving tastes, diverse alternatives, and curiosity. In response, businesses in marketing and branding strive to foster brand loyalty and discourage switching. They do so by offering distinct value, nurturing emotional connections, and ensuring consistent quality and experiences to encourage repeat purchases and brand preference. Demanding sustainability and affordability Today’s consumers are demanding a dual focus on sustainability and affordability. They’re increasingly conscious of the environmental impact of their purchases and are actively seeking eco-friendly options. Simultaneously, they’re mindful of their budgets, expecting sustainable choices not to break the bank. Consumers increasingly favour sustainable products, with 84% considering sustainability very important in their buying choices. Yet, in times of inflation, 50% remain uncertain about paying a premium for sustainability. From affordable EVs to budget-friendly organic foods and clothes, companies are realizing that sustainability is no longer a premium add-on but a necessity. This consumer-driven demand is reshaping markets, encouraging responsible practices, and ultimately creating a win-win scenario for both the planet and our wallets. Don’t miss out.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (form 10-K) March 31, 2023 at 02:32 am IST Share The following discussion and analysis provides information that our management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The statements in this discussion regarding expected and other production timelines, development of our own manufacturing facilities, industry trends, our expectations regarding our future performance, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in Part I, Item 1A. ""Risk Factors"" and ""Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."" Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Certain figures included in this section have been rounded for ease of presentation. Percentage figures included in this section have not in all cases been calculated on the basis of such rounded figures but on the basis of such amounts prior to rounding. For this reason, percentage amounts in this section may vary slightly from those obtained by performing the same calculations using the figures in our financial statements or in the associated text. Certain other amounts that appear in this section may similarly not sum due to rounding. Overview Canoo is a high tech advanced mobility technology company with a mission to bring electric vehicles (""EVs"") to everyone and provide connected services that improve the fleet or individual vehicle ownership experience. We are developing a technology platform that we believe will enable us to rapidly innovate, iterate and bring new products, addressing multiple use cases, to market faster than our competition and at lower cost. Our vehicle architecture and design philosophy are aimed at driving productivity and returning capital to our customers, and we believe the software and technology capabilities we are developing, packaged around a modular, customizable product, have the potential to empower the customer experience across a vehicle's lifecycle. We remain committed to the environment and to delivering sustainable mobility that is accessible to everyone. We proudly intend to manufacture our fully electric vehicles in Oklahoma , bringing advanced manufacturing and technology jobs to communities in America's heartland. We are committed to building a diverse workforce that will draw heavily upon the local communities of Native Americans and veterans. We believe we are one of the first automotive manufacturers focused on monetizing value across the entirety of the vehicle lifecycle, across multiple owners. Our platform and data architecture is purpose-built to be durable and serve as the foundation for the vehicles we intend to offer, unlocking a highly differentiated, multi-layer business model. The foundational layer is our Multi-Purpose Platform (""MPP"" or ""platform"") architecture, which serves as the base of our vehicles, including the Lifestyle Vehicle and its Delivery, Base, Premium, and Adventure trims; the Multi-Purpose Delivery Vehicle (""MPDV"") and the Pickup. The next layer is cybersecurity which is embedded in our vehicle to ensure the privacy and protection of vehicle data. Our top hats, or cabins, are modular and purpose-built to provide tailored solutions for our customers. This intentional design enables us to efficiently use resources to produce only what is necessary, underscoring our focus on sustainability and returning capital to customers. The remaining layers, connected accessories and digital customer ecosystem, present high-margin opportunities that extend beyond the initial vehicle sale, 59 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Table of Contents across multiple owners. Owners will further be able to customize their vehicles by adding connected accessories such as Bluetooth devices or infotainment systems. In addition, there are opportunities for software sales throughout the vehicle life, including predictive maintenance and service software or advanced driver assistance systems (""ADAS"") upgrades. Our platform architecture is a self-contained, fully functional rolling chassis that directly houses the most critical components for operation of an EV, including our in-house designed proprietary electric drivetrain, battery systems, advanced vehicle control electronics and software and other critical components, which all have been optimized for functional integration. Both our true steer-by-wire system, believed to be the first such system applied to a production-intent vehicle, and our transverse composite leaf-spring suspension system are core components of our platform's differentiated functionality, enabling the development of a broad range of vehicle types and use cases due to the chassis' flat profile and fully variable steering positions. All of our announced vehicles, including the Lifestyle Vehicle and the Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle, the MPDV and the Pickup, will share a common platform architecture paired with different top hats to create a range of uniquely customized and use case optimized purpose-built mobility solutions targeting multiple segments of the rapidly expanding EV marketplace. In addition to our vehicle technology, we are developing an in-house designed and proprietary software platform that aggregates car data from both Canoo and non- Canoo vehicles and delivers valuable insights to our customers. Collected over-the-air for connected vehicles or via an on-board diagnostics (""OBD"") device for non-connected vehicles, we believe car data is critical to powering the customer journey and maximizing utility and value from the vehicle ownership experience. Leveraging our data aggregation platform, we aim to create the Canoo Digital Ecosystem, an application store that centralizes all vehicle information for customers and provides key tools across Security & Safety, Household Vehicle Management, Fleet Management, Lifecycle Management and Vehicle Asset Management. Through our software offering, we believe we can provide differentiated and substantial value to both commercial customers and consumers and stay connected throughout the vehicle lifecycle, across multiple owners. Core to our values is delivering high quality products while empowering local communities, which drove our decision to build in America and source a majority of our parts from America and allied nations. We believe vertical integration across our manufacturing and assembly process will enable us to achieve in-house scale production with less supply chain risk and provide us better oversight of our vehicle manufacturing. We are building production facilities in states and communities that are investing in high-tech manufacturing alongside us, creating American jobs and driving innovation. We have made strategic investments in our technology and products that position us to capture three large and growing markets - commercial and passenger vehicles, upfitting and accessories, and telematics data. Since our founding in 2017, we continue to innovate on our technology and strategy. In 2022, we have achieved critical milestones in the development, testing, and manufacturing of our platform and product, as well as important developments for our business: •Selected by NASA to provide crew transport for Artemis lunar exploration launch •Received Walmart order to purchase up to 10,000 units •Announced binding orders from Zeeba and KingBee totaling 12,300 vehicles •Successfully built and tested 118 Gamma properties during the program •Announced battery module manufacturing facility in Pryor, OK •Delivered Light Tactical Vehicle (LTV) to US Army for analysis and demonstration •Announced in-house vehicle manufacturing facility in Oklahoma City •Declared start of production We continue to innovate and develop every aspect of our business, from our non-traditional business model to our built in America, highly utilitarian vehicles optimized to return capital to our customers. We believe being forward-thinking across these areas has set the foundation for us to develop into a scalable business that is differentiated from our peers across the automotive original equipment manufacturer (""OEM"") landscape. 60 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Table of Contents Key Factors Affecting Operating Results We believe that our performance and future success depend on several factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed below and in Item 1A, ""Risk Factors."" Availability of Financing Sources and Commercialization of Our EVs We expect to derive future revenue from our first vehicle offerings. In order to reach commercialization, we must purchase and integrate related property and equipment, as well as achieve several research and development milestones. Our capital and operating expenditures have increased significantly in connection with our ongoing activities and we expect they will continue to increase, as we: •continue to invest in our technology, research and development efforts; •compensate existing personnel; •invest in manufacturing capacity, via our owned facilities; •increase our investment in marketing, advertising, sales and distribution infrastructure for our EVs and services; •obtain, maintain and improve our operational, financial and management information systems; •hire additional personnel; •commercialize our EVs; •obtain, maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and •continue to operate as a public company. We require substantial additional capital to develop our EVs and services and fund our operations for the foreseeable future. We will also require capital to identify and commit resources to investigate new areas of demand. Until we can generate sufficient revenue from vehicle sales, we are financing our operations through access to private and public equity offerings and debt financings. Management believes substantial doubt exists about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the date of issuance of the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Macroeconomic Conditions Current adverse macroeconomic conditions, including but not limited to heightened inflation, slower growth or recession, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, higher interest rates, currency fluctuations, and challenges in the supply chain could negatively affect our business. Increased demand for semiconductor chips in 2020, due in part to the increased demand for consumer electronics that use these chips, resulted in a global shortage of chips in 2021 that has continued into 2023. As a result, our ability to source semiconductor chips used in our vehicles may be adversely affected. This shortage may result in increased chip delivery lead times, delays in the production of our vehicles, and increased costs to source available semiconductor chips. Although we have made our best estimates based upon current information, actual results could materially differ from the estimates and assumptions developed by management. Accordingly, it is reasonably possible that the estimates made in the financial statements have been, or will be, materially and adversely impacted in the near term as a result of these conditions, and if so, we may be subject to future impairment losses related to long-lived assets as well as changes to valuations. 61 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Table of Contents Key Components of Statements of Operations Basis of Presentation Currently, we conduct business through one operating segment. We are an early stage-growth company with limited commercial activities to date, which are primarily conducted in the United States . For more information about our basis of presentation, refer to Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Research and Development Expenses, excluding Depreciation Research and development expenses, excluding depreciation consist of salaries, employee benefits and expenses for design and engineering, stock-based compensation, as well as materials and supplies used in research and development activities. In addition, research and development expenses include fees for consulting and engineering services from third party vendors. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses, excluding Depreciation The principal components of our selling, general and administrative expenses are salaries, wages, benefits and bonuses paid to our employees; stock-based compensation; travel and other business expenses; and professional services fees, including legal, audit and tax services. Depreciation Expense Depreciation is provided on property and equipment over the estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. Upon retirement or disposal, the cost of the asset disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in the loss from operations. No depreciation expense is allocated to research and development, cost of revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses. Interest (Expense) Income Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs. Gain on Fair Value Change in Contingent Earnout Shares Liability The gain on fair value change in the contingent earnout shares liability is due to the change in fair value of the corresponding contingent earnout shares liability. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt The loss on extinguishment of debt arose from the redemption of our convertible debt with Yorkville into Common Stock, as discussed in Note 9, Convertible Debt. 62 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Table of Contents Results of Operations Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 Commentary for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020 may be found in Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") on March 1, 2022 , (""2021 Form 10-K"").

The increase of $53.0 million , or 22%, was primarily due to an increase in salary and related benefits expense of $39.8 million , stock-based compensation expense of $5.3 million , travel and other business expenses of $4.4 million , and shipping costs of $4.1 million . Other factors affecting research and development expenses were individually immaterial. Salary and related benefits expense was $126.8 million for the for the year ended December 31, 2022 , compared to $87.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 . The increase of $39.8 million , or 46%, in salary and related benefits expenses are primarily due to continued investment in personnel and contract employees to drive and reach our research and development goals. Stock-based compensation expense was $31.1 million for the for the year ended December 31, 2022 , compared to $25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 . The increase of $5.3 million , or 21%, in stock-based compensation expense was primarily driven by the continued recognition of stock compensation expense related to issuance of awards to employees and the commencement of the ESPP program during the year ended December 31, 2022 . See further discussion in Note 15, Stock-based Compensation, of the notes to our accompanying financial statements. Travel and other business expenses were $7.4 million for the for the year ended December 31, 2022 , compared to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 . The increase of $4.4 million , or 147%, in travel and expense costs are primarily due to travel related to gamma stage engineering design and development costs. 63 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Table of Contents Shipping costs were $7.7 million for the for the year ended December 31, 2022 , compared to $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 . The increase of $4.1 million , or 114%, in shipping costs are primarily due to investments in research and development and manufacturing activities to achieve start of production in late 2022. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses, excluding Depreciation Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $196.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 , compared to $194.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 . The increase of $1.3 million , was primarily due to a decrease of $34.1 million in stock-based compensation expenses and $0.4 million in professional fees, more than offset by an increase in salary and related benefits of $18.2 million , information technology expenses of $12.0 million , and occupancy costs of $4.6 million . Other factors affecting selling, general and administrative expenses were individually immaterial. Stock-based compensation expense was $48.5 million for the for the year ended December 31, 2022 , compared to $82.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 . The decrease of $34.1 million , or 41%, in stock-based compensation expense was primarily driven by the granting of certain non-routine awards, some of which vested immediately during the year ended December 31, 2021 , partially offset by the continued recognition of stock compensation expense related to issuance of awards to employees during the year ended December 31, 2022 .

The change of $78.4 million , or 75.1%, was a result of the periodic remeasurement of the fair value of our contingent earnout shares liability. 64 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Table of Contents Loss on Fair Value Change of Private Placement Warrants Liability We recognized a non-cash loss on fair value change of private placement warrants liability of $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 which was a result of the periodic remeasurement of the fair value of our private placement warrants liability. All of the private placement warrants were converted to public warrants on March 2, 2021 . Loss on Extinguishment of Debt We recognized $4.6 million of extinguishment of debt loss as a result of repayments made to Yorkville of convertible debt through the issuance of shares during the year ended December 31, 2022 . Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to our results determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""GAAP""), we believe the following non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating our operational performance. We use the following non-GAAP measures to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors in assessing our operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrants liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with net loss are beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures. 65 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Table of Contents The following table reconciles net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Net loss $ (487,694) $ (346,768) Interest expense (income) 2,249 (103) Depreciation 11,554 8,921 EBITDA (473,891) (337,950) Adjustments: Gain on fair value change in contingent earnout shares liability (26,044) (104,446) Loss on fair value change in private placement warrants liability - 1,639 Loss on extinguishment of debt 4,626 - Other (expense) income, net 62 (224) Stock-based compensation 79,573 108,360 SEC settlement (Note 12) 1,500 - Non-cash legal settlement (Note 12) 5,532 - Adjusted EBITDA (408,642) (332,621) Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2022 , we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $36.6 million , which was primarily invested in money market funds that consist of liquid debt securities issued by the U.S. government. In assessing our liquidity requirements and cash needs, we also consider contractual obligations to which we are a party. Additionally, see discussion related to the operating lease maturity schedule and any new leases entered into in Note 10 of the notes to our accompanying financial statements. We have incurred and expect to incur, net losses which have resulted in an accumulated deficit of $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2022 . Management continues to explore raising additional capital through a combination of debt financing, other non-dilutive financing and/or equity financing to supplement the Company's capitalization and liquidity. If and as we raise additional funds by incurring loans or by issuing debt securities or preferred stock, these forms of financing have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our Common Stock. The availability and the terms under which we are able to raise additional capital could be disadvantageous, and the terms of debt financing or other non-dilutive financing involve restrictive covenants and dilutive financing instruments, which could place significant restrictions on our operations. Macroeconomic conditions and credit markets are also impacting the availability and cost of potential future debt financing. As we raise capital through the issuance of additional equity, such sales and issuance has and will continue to dilute the ownership interests of the existing holders of Common Stock. There can be no assurances that any additional debt, other non-dilutive and/or equity financing would be available to us on favorable terms or at all. We expect to continue to incur net losses, comprehensive losses, and negative cash flows from operating activities in accordance with our operating plan as we continue to expand our research and development activities to complete the development of our MPP and EVs, establish our go-to-market model and scale our operations to meet anticipated demand. We expect that both our capital and operating expenditures will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, as we: •continue to invest in our technology, research and development efforts; •compensate existing personnel; •invest in manufacturing capacity, via our owned facilities; •increase our investment in marketing, advertising, sales and distribution infrastructure for our EVs and services; •obtain, maintain and improve our operational, financial and management information systems; •hire additional personnel; 66 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Table of Contents •commercialize our EVs; •obtain, maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and •operate as a public company. As of the date of this report, we believe that our existing cash resources and additional sources of liquidity are not sufficient to support planned operations for the next 12 months. Our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty related to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Cash Flows Summary Presented below is a summary of our operating, investing and financing cash flows (in thousands): For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Net cash used in operating activities $ (400,475) $ (300,816) Net cash used in investing activities (66,830) (162,728) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 290,428 (11,386) Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by the growth of our business primarily related to research and development as well as selling, general, and administrative activities.

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $66.8 million , which consisted of purchases of production tooling, machinery, and equipment to support manufacturing activities of $97.3 million , offset by a repayment received in February 2022 totaling $30.4 million from VDL Nedcar. 67 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Table of Contents Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $162.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 , which primarily consisted of purchases of fixed assets that are recorded in construction in progress specifically related to the development of manufacturing lines as well as equipment and tooling necessary in the production of the Company's vehicles. Net cash used in investing activities was also comprised of the prepayment made to VDL Nedcar. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $290.4 million , which consisted primarily of proceeds from PPA of $141.1 million , proceeds from issuance of shares under PIPE of $60.0 million , proceeds from issuance of shares under ATM of $49.3 million , proceeds from issuance of shares under SEPA agreement of $32.5 million , and proceeds from the purchase of shares by VDL Nedcar of $8.4 million , partially offset by cash repayments under the PPA of $2.5 million . Net cash used in financing activities was $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 , which was primarily due to the $11.3 million in payments for offering costs. The $6.9 million repayment of the PPP loan during the year was offset by $6.9 million in cash received from exercise of public warrants. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates. While our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies require a greater degree of judgment and complexity and are the most critical to understanding our financial condition and historical and future results of operations: Contingent Earnout Shares Liability The Company has a contingent obligation to issue shares of Common Stock to certain stockholders and employees upon the achievement of certain market share price milestones within specified periods (the ""Earnout Shares""). The initial fair value of our contingent Earnout Shares liability was recognized at $248.9 million with a corresponding reduction from the additional paid in capital in our stockholders' equity. The terms and conditions of the right to receive Earnout Shares are described in Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In accordance with the guidance under Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the Earnout Shares right are classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement liability, and the increase or decrease in the fair value during the reporting period is recognized as other expense or other income in our consolidated statement of operations accordingly. The fair value of the contingent Earnout Shares liability was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation of stock prices using an expected volatility assumption based on the historical volatility of the price of the Company's Common Stock and implied volatility derived from the price of exchange traded options on the Company's Common Stock. Changes in these inputs or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of the contingent Earnout Shares liability. Changes to contingent earnout shares liability can result from changes to discount rates or accretion of the liability due to the passage of time. The determination of the contingent Earnout Shares liability requires significant judgments including the appropriateness of the valuation model, reasonableness of estimates and assumptions, and the discount rates applied to such forecasts. 68 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Table of Contents As of December 31, 2021 , the fair value of our contingent Earnout Shares liability was estimated to be $29.1 million . We recognized a gain on fair value change in contingent Earnout Shares liability of $104.4 million as other income in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 . As of December 31, 2022 , the fair value of our contingent Earnout Shares liability was estimated to be $3.0 million . We recognized a gain on fair value change in contingent Earnout Shares liability of $26.0 million as other income in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 . Warrants We account for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the instruments' specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480 and ASC 815, as further described in Note 2. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the instruments are outstanding. The Company concluded that the warrants issued to Walmart and vested as of December 31, 2022 qualify for equity accounting treatment. The equity classified warrants are measured at fair value on its grant date using a Black-Scholes-Merton model, with no fair value re-measurement at each reporting period given equity classification. The Company concluded that the warrants issued to Yorkville as of December 31, 2022 qualify for liability accounting treatment. The liability classified warrants are measured at fair value on its grant date using a Black-Scholes-Merton model, with fair value re-measurement at each reporting period given its classification. Refer to Note 16 for information regarding the warrants issued to Walmart and Yorkville. Stock-Based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation awards granted to employees and members of our Board based on the awards' estimated grant date fair value using a fair value method. For awards that vest solely based on continued service (""requisite service""), the resulting fair value is recognized as an expense on an accelerated basis over the requisite service period, which is generally four years. For awards which contain performance conditions, the resulting fair value is recognized over the requisite service period using the graded vesting method, when it is probable the performance conditions will be met. We account for forfeitures as they occur. We estimate the fair value of RSUs based on the market price of our Common Stock underlying the awards on the grant date. Fair value for awards with our stock price performance metrics is calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation model, which incorporates stock price correlation and other variables over the time horizons matching the performance periods. The assumptions underlying these valuations represent management's best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change and our management uses significantly different assumptions or estimates, our stock-based compensation expense for future periods could be materially different, including as a result of adjustments to stock-based compensation expense recorded for prior periods. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 total stock-based compensation expense was $79.6 million and $108.4 million , respectively. Smaller Reporting Company Status Based on the aggregate worldwide market value of voting and non-voting Common Stock held by non-affiliates as of June 30, 2022 , we re-qualified as a ""non-accelerated filer"" beginning with this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 . Therefore, our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to provide the attestation report on our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in this Annual Report. In addition, we re-qualified as a ""smaller reporting company"", given that the market value of our Common Stock held by non-affiliates was less than the subsequent qualification threshold of $560.0 million and our annual revenue was less than $80.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies and will be able to take advantage of these scaled disclosures for so long as the market value of our voting and non-voting Common Stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, or our annual revenue is less than $100.0 million during the 69 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Table of Contents most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our voting and non-voting Common Stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter.

However, last quarter, Canoo was warning it might not have enough cash to stay in business. Three months later, the EV startup-gone-SPAC is touting access to enough capital to see it through the rest of 2022. “We are preparing for [start of production] readiness,” said Ramesh Murthy, chief accounting officer at Canoo, during Monday’s earnings call. “ We have customers. We have access to capital. We have a strategy that benefits our company and shareholders against the backdrop of this global economic condition. We are making it happen.” Canoo says it has closed out the quarter with more than $1 billion in its sales pipeline. This is largely attributable to a recent deal with Walmart to purchase 4,500 units, with an option to buy up to 10,000 units. Canoo also scored a deal to supply its multi-purpose platform to the U.S. Army for analysis and demonstration, which could lead to sales in the future. The company also recently unveiled the EVs it’s making for NASA. Like many EV SPACs, Canoo has had a tough time, and is likely still reeling from its past controversies, which include internal drama, legal issues, production delays and an SEC investigation. That said, there appears to be light at the end of this tunnel. Canoo’s shares hiked almost 7% after the company released its Q2 results. Let’s dig in. Canoo’s financial results While Canoo does have quite a lot of potential money in the pipeline, the company has still not brought in any revenue since making its public debut in December 2020. Canoo saw a net loss of $164.4 million in the second quarter and $289.8 million in the first half of the year, compared to a loss of $112.6 million and $127.8 million in the same periods last year, respectively. In Q1, Canoo was struggling to get the cash it needed. When the company announced its results in May, it still hadn’t realized the gains of the $300 million private investment in public equity (PIPE) investment from its SPAC. Canoo had also filed a $300 million universal shelf, all of which would be necessary to make it to the start of production. As a result of the delayed funds, Canoo issued a growing concern warning. Today, Canoo is singing a different tune. The company closed out the quarter with access to $250 million, which includes about $220 million of unused capacity on its SEPA facility, and cash and cash equivalents of $33.8 million. Notably, while there’s certainly access to capital here, it’s not actually cash on hand, which in reality is close to pennies for an EV company. Tony Aquila, CEO of Canoo, has said he’s committed to raising money without diluting shareholders. The company said it has entered into an agreement with Evercore Group and H.C. Wainwright & Co. for an up-to $200 million at-the-market offering. In addition to this ATM offering, Canoo has announced a $300 million mixed shelf offering and a $250 million “standby equity purchase agreement” with Yorkville Advisors. Additionally, as Canoo has previously mentioned, the company has secured more than $400 million in non-dilutive incentives from the states of Oklahoma — where Canoo is expanding operations at its first U.S. factory and establishing a technology hub and customer support and finance center — and Arkansas, where Canoo is setting up headquarters and another technology hub. Oklahoma agreed in March to buy 1,000 Canoo EVs , but the state can always pull out of that agreement. Walmart to the rescue? When Walmart agreed to buy 4,500 electric delivery vehicles from Canoo in July, no doubt the company and its investors all breathed a collective sigh of relief. Not only did that assure future revenue for Canoo, but it also gives the company another opportunity to go after additional non-dilutive and lower cost capital financing opportunities, said Murthy. “The first agreement represents $300 million of potential revenue for us with an additional path of deeper partnership opportunities to generate revenue for us with our new partner,” said Aquila. Presumably, having clout with Walmart will also lead to additional partnerships with other partners in the future, but per Walmart’s agreement with Canoo, rival Amazon will not be one of them . That said, Canoo added a new risk factor to its regulatory following following the Walmart deal, saying that the company expects “a substantial portion of [its] initial revenue will be from one customer.” If Canoo is unable to hold up its end of the bargain, or Walmart decides to purchase fewer vehicles, or none at all, Canoo’s business will be adversely affected. And it’s important to note that Walmart does in fact have the option of pulling out of the deal, as long as it provides 30 days notice. Keeping lean and quick Canoo spent $115.5 million on R&D in the second quarter, which probably helped the company figure out how to get its total parts used on its EV platform down to 1,600, as compared to 1,800 last quarter. This is also partly due to Canoo’s decision to prioritize domestic manufacturing, which the company says will lead to higher margin business wins with commercial fleet operators, as well as have a meaningful long-term impact on total cost of ownership. “This approach has aided us in dealing with the inflationary and supply chain environments, which not only affect the first owner but every owner thereafter, allowing us to demonstrate that the future is about becoming a TEM not just an OEM,” said Aquila, nodding to Canoo’s tech-first approach. Aquila also noted that it would outsource initial production to a third party, but didn’t go into details. Canoo said it was able to double the total number of Gamma properties it manufactured in the second quarter, bringing the total number up to 89 and more than doubling the number of vehicles since Canoo last reported. In fact, during the second quarter, Canoo was able to hand off its Gamma build for certification to meet Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards requirements. The result of having more vehicles at the ready is that Canoo now has $275 million in fixed assets as of June 30, which the company says can also be leveraged for additional non-dilutive financing. Updated guidance With a focus on SOP in Q4 2022, Canoo expects its operating expenses for the remainder of the year to be between $200 million and $245 million, excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation. That’s a 20% decrease in spending in the second half than the first because the company is completing its Gamma phase investments and moving closer to commercial production, according to Murthy. Canoo expects capital expenditures of $100 million to $125 million, and Murthy said this is primarily related to facility readiness, machinery and equipment and production tooling. “These investments will get our [Lifestyle Delivery Vehicle] in the hands of paying customers and support another milestone of 20,000 run rate in 2023,” said Murthy. Spending in 2023 will continue on Canoo’s current pace in order to achieve 2023 production guidance, continued Murthy, noting that in order to achieve other long-term business aspirations, the company will need to tap additional capital. Aquila mentioned a potential for an additional $85 million in the future, but didn’t go into details. He did seem optimistic that Canoo would have further access to capital since pulling forward some of its build-out programs. This article has been updated to include mention of an equity deal and Canoo’s plans to outsource initial manufacturing to a third party.
